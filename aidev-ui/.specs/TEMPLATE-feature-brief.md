# Feature: {Feature Name}

## Problem
What's broken or missing, and for whom?

## Who Benefits
End users? Internal team? Both?

## Success Criteria
How will we know it works? Measurable outcome.

## Visual Requirements

### Figma Link
{URL if existing design, or "AI will generate — review in Figma"}

### Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile (< 640px): {requirements}
- Tablet (640-1024px): {requirements}
- Desktop (> 1024px): {requirements}

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA baseline
- {Additional requirements: screen reader optimization, etc.}

### Animation/Interaction
{Static | Subtle transitions | Rich animations — describe expectations}

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional
- [ ] AC1: {User can do X and sees Y}
- [ ] AC2: {When X happens, Y updates}

### Visual
- [ ] AC-V1: {Component matches Figma design at all breakpoints}
- [ ] AC-V2: {Color contrast meets WCAG AA}

### Accessibility
- [ ] AC-A1: {All interactive elements keyboard navigable}
- [ ] AC-A2: {Screen reader announces component correctly}

## Time Appetite
{How much time should we spend?}

## What We're NOT Building
{Explicit no-gos}

## Known Risks
{Where might we get stuck?}

## Existing Patterns
{Similar implementations found in the codebase}
